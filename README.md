#Game Concept
Points fall from the sky constantly in two colors, black and white. 
The player needs to get those of the opposite color of the background. If the bg is white, the black points and the white points kill them and vice-versa.
Every 15 seconds the bg changes colors.

- The player's jump varies height according to how long they press space.
- Logic manager controlling the color switches and game over logic.
- Player has gravity pulling their down after jump's highpoint
- Sound plays for scores
